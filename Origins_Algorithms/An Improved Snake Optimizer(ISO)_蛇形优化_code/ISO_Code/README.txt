To enhance the performance of the Snake Optimizer, we propose an improved version with multi-strategy enhancement, referred to as ISO.
 ISO incorporates a variety of novel enhancement strategies,
 including the Multi-Strategy Chaotic System (MSCS) in the initial algorithm phase, 
Anti-Predator Strategies (APS) during the exploration phase, 
and Bidirectional Population Evolution Dynamics (BPED) in the exploitation phase.
