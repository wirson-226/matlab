#####
This is an optimized MATLAB version of the Knapsack Problem using ISO.

#####
Among them, att48 is a recognized data set for the Knapsack Problem.

#####
This code is very easy to develop and deploy locally.
You only need to run the main file and get the optimization results of the Knapsack Problem (KP8) using ISO. 
The optimization results are the Maximum valu.
